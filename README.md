# Unity maze game
I have created an interactive game using Unity where the player moves a ball through a maze to complete the objective. 
- Game was created using unity properties and coded using C# scripts attached to player and objects.
- Game went through debugging and testing phases as well as design changes to achieve an interactive and captivating game for players.
